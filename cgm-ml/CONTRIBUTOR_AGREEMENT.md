In order for You (as defined below) to make intellectual property Contributions (as defined below) now or in the

have any questions about this agreement, licensing, or anything related to intellectual property at Welthungerhilfe,

Please read this WCA carefully before accepting its terms. By accepting the WCA, You are agreeing to be bound by

As used in this WCA: (i) “You" (or "Your") shall mean the entity that is making this Agreement with Welthungerhilfe;
(ii)"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an 
existing work, that is submitted by You to Welthungerhilfe for inclusion in, or documentation of, any Welthungerhilfe 
projects; and (iii) “Submit” (or “Submitted”) means any form of communication sent to Welthungerhilfe (e.g. the content
You post on electronic mailing lists, forums, content management systems, source code control systems, code review 
systems, issue tracking systems, etc. that are used by Welthungerhilfe).

This agreement applies to all Contributions You Submit.

This WCA, and the license(s) associated with the particular Welthungerhilfe projects You are contributing to, provides
a license to Your Contributions to Welthungerhilfe and downstream consumers, but You still own Your Contributions, and
